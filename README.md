# AI Infra Learning
This repository tracks my 6-month AI Infrastructure learning journey.

## Week 1 â€“ Day 1
- Verified C++20 environment with a simple concept-based program.
- Verified Python ML stack (`numpy`, `pandas`, `torch`, `sklearn`) is installed.
- Checked CUDA GPU availability in PyTorch.
- Set up GitHub repo structure.
